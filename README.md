# TourneyShotsBakkesmodPlugin
Displays the shots each team has taken, as well as the differential, in tied tournament games. 
The user can toggle whether it needs to be in a tournament and if it needs to be tied. 
Currently only displays correctly in my resolution (1920x1080), will hopefully update in the future.
